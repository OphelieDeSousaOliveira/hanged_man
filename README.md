# hanged_man
  Hanged man game created to be implement in my Pypet project... But not ready yet because learn to play to hanged man to a program was no as easy as I though (i was young and enthusiastic!)  Need some adds like a better management of end game and, incidentally, a better dictionary (because playing to guess "mouton" (sheep) again and again will going to make me crazy!)
